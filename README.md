# IMR-Project

Coursework 
A supermarket is planning to have a customized POS (point of sale) system to manage 
their crowd and the tasks. They wanted to focus on Customer, Stock, Discount, Sales 
and reporting related to their business. The Owner of the organization expecting to take 
decisions based on the reports which is provided by the system daily/monthly for the 
development.  
You have been hired with the team to consider this scenario to make the database 
system for the organization and to check the real time working condition it is expected 
to develop a software (Any Programing Language) to perform at least a single 
operation on the above database.  
Tasks 
The aim of this coursework is to analyse the above case study to design and develop 
a database in Microsoft SQL Server including high data integrity and data validation to 
facilitate the following. 
1. Allow the administrative staff to enter and maintain details about all the project 
activities. Your application should include appropriate data validation 
mechanisms (constraints), triggers and user defined functions. 
2. Allow authorized parties to view details to generate meaningful management 
reports to make strategic, long term and short-term managerial decisions. Your 
application should include appropriate views and stored procedures to 
retrieve operational data. 
Deliverables 
Deliverable 1 
You should submit a document (soft copy) containing: 
Section 1: 
• A basic introduction to the scenario with the important facts you have 
identified and considered to your solution. (Do not copy and paste the 
given scenario as it is) 
• An Entity Relationship (ER) or Extended Entity Relationship (EER) 
Diagram showing all of the entities, their attributes, relationships, 
cardinality ratio and the participation constraints. (Should include a 
sensibly resized diagram which clearly show all the elements) 
• A list of any additional assumptions you have made which affect your 
solution. 
2 
Coursework 2024-2025 
• Relational Mapping (Have to clearly indicate the steps of relational 
mapping with all table attributes, primary keys and foreign keys) 
• Data Normalization (Have to clearly indicate all the steps of up data 
normalization up to Third normalization form). 
• Data Dictionary of each normalized table. (Should contain all the details 
about each table field) 
Section 2: 
• Microsoft SQL Server creates table statements with related Constraints 
for each table to validate data. (Should include sensibly resized 
screenshots of all the table creation statements which clearly show all the 
SQL statements) 
• Database Diagram of your solution. (Should include a sensibly resized 
diagram which clearly show all the elements) 
• A set of relevant and sensibly sized screen shots showing all the tables 
in your application with some meaningful sample records. (Should insert 
more than 10 meaningful sample records to each table in your database). 
Section 3: 
• Microsoft SQL Server Create Trigger statements for the triggers that you 
have created. (Should create at least two triggers for your database and 
should provide sensibly resized screenshots of the SQL statements) 
• Microsoft SQL Server Create Function statements for the user defined 
functions that you have created. (Should create at least two user defined 
functions for your database and should provide sensibly resized 
screenshots of the SQL statements) 
• Microsoft SQL Server Create View statements for the database views 
that you have created. (Should create at least two database views for 
your database and should provide sensibly resized screenshots of the 
SQL statements) 
• Microsoft SQL Server Create Procedure statements for the stored 
procedures that you have created. (Should create at least two stored 
procedures for your database and should provide sensibly resized 
screenshots of the SQL statements) 
Section 4: 
• A critical appraisal of your solution highlighting worthy features, together 
with any shortcomings and how they might be resolved. 
• Comments on future implementation of your application. Note that you 
should include all the SQL queries you have created within your database 
including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation 
language (DML) for tables, triggers, views, stored procedures and user

defined functions. You should provide sensibly resized screenshots to 
show all the SQL statements within the database that you have created. 
Deliverable 2 
A complete backup of your database (.bak) with a softcopy of Deliverable 1 (.docx 
or .pdf) and the Presentation slide show (.pptx) also should be included in the 
submission. Note that any part of your submission in an incorrect file format cannot be 
marked. Coursework may be submitted at any time ahead of the deadline time. Please 
note the University regulations concerning late submission of coursework. Please note 
that the late submissions of project deliverables will not be assessed. 
Deliverable 3  
You will be required to perform a 5-minute presentation of your solution followed by a 
10-minute question and answer (viva) session. 
Note that the database objects and applications may be accessed in your absence as 
part of the assessment process. You should ensure that your tables are populated with 
an adequate amount of sensible test data in advance of this session, and it is 
particularly important that date and time-dependent data is applicable to the date and 
time of your solution. 
The presentation and viva will be taken according to a schedule prepared by NSBM. 
Students will be informed about the schedule.
